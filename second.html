		I'm a computer science student and this is the <br> first website I've designed where I had to spend <br> many hours just to make each page, but, to be <br> completely honest, it was enjoyable. On this website, <br> I will be sharing some things about myself. <br> So, prepare to get to know me by browsing <br> every page of my website. What are you waiting for? <br> Click on the next page! If you're interested, that is.</p>
